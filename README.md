# 🐶 Dog vs Cat Image Classifier

A deep learning–based web application that classifies images as **Dog** or **Cat** using a **ResNet-18** model trained with PyTorch.  
The trained model is deployed using a **Flask web app** that allows users to upload images and get predictions with confidence scores.
